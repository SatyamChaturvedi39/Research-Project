## What is NBA Trade Analyzer?

NBA Trade Analyzer is a full-stack intelligent web application that **predicts how NBA players will perform after a trade** — not just how they performed last season. It combines machine learning, injury analytics, salary cap rules, and Monte Carlo simulations to produce a single, definitive **Trade Score (0–100)** that tells you whether a deal helps or hurts your team.

Every prediction comes with a **plain-English explanation** powered by Explainable AI, so you always know *why* the system made its judgment.

## How It Works

You select two NBA teams. You pick the players each team is sending out. You hit **Analyze Trade**. In under 3 seconds, the system:

1. **Predicts next-season performance** for every player involved using 5 years of historical patterns.
2. **Classifies injury risk** by analyzing each player's medical history and games missed.
3. **Checks roster fit** — detects positional logjams and scoring cannibalization that would limit production.
4. **Simulates 500 possible seasons** using Monte Carlo methods to project total team wins before and after the trade.
5. **Validates salary cap compliance** to ensure the trade is financially feasible under NBA CBA rules.
6. **Calculates a final Trade Score** with a full breakdown of what's driving the number up or down.

## Models & Intelligence Layer

The system runs **three distinct machine learning models** working in concert, plus a rule-based simulation engine.

### 1. Player Performance Model — XGBoost MultiOutput Regressor

The core prediction engine. It does not simply look at last season's averages — it processes **54 engineered temporal features** across a 5-year rolling window per player.

**Feature Categories:**

| Category | Features | What They Capture |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Base Statistics | 16 | Current season metrics: PPG, RPG, APG, TS%, usage rate, points per minute, etc. |
| Lag Features | 26 | Historical stats going back 1–5 seasons (e.g., PPG from 3 years ago vs today) |
| Trend Slopes | 4 | Mathematical trajectory — is the player improving or declining year-over-year? |
| Career Architecture | 8 | Peak PPG, years since peak, career consistency (coefficient of variation), career averages |

**Targets Predicted:**
| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| PPG | Points Per Game |
| RPG | Rebounds Per Game |
| APG | Assists Per Game |
| MPG | Minutes Per Game |
| TS% | True Shooting Percentage |

**Validated Accuracy (Backtested vs. actual 2024–25 season):**

| Metric | MAE | R² | What This Means |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| PPG | 1.37 | 0.919 | Predictions land within ~1 basket of actual scoring output |
| RPG | 0.52 | 0.908 | Highly reliable rebounding forecasts |
| APG | 0.36 | 0.926 | Excellent assist prediction precision |
| MPG | 2.81 | 0.847 | Strong minutes projection with minor variance |
| TS% | 0.04 | -1.21 | Known limitation — shooting % is inherently volatile season-to-season |

**Hyperparameters:** `n_estimators=200`, `max_depth=5`, `learning_rate=0.05`, `min_child_weight=5`

### 2. Injury Risk Classifier — Random Forest

Evaluates 5 years of player medical history — total games missed, severity classifications (minor/moderate/severe), and frequency patterns — to assign a probabilistic injury risk rating.

| Risk Category | Probability Range | Impact on Trade Score |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Low | < 15% | Minimal penalty |
| Moderate | 15–35% | Moderate reduction in projected wins |
| High | 35–60% | Significant penalty; flagged in UI |
| Very High | > 60% | Severe reduction; trade likely rated "Harmful" |

**Validation:** ROC-AUC of 0.575 against held-out 2024–25 injury data. Reflective of the inherent randomness of sports injuries — the model identifies patterns where they exist without overfitting to noise.

### 3. SHAP Explainability Engine — TreeExplainer

Every single prediction is run through a SHAP TreeExplainer that decomposes the XGBoost output into individual feature contributions. These raw SHAP values are then translated into natural-language sentences displayed directly in the UI.

**Example outputs:**
- *"His 3-year scoring trend is strongly upward, adding +2.1 points to the projection."*
- *"At age 35, the age factor is pulling the estimate down by -1.8 points."*
- *"Career consistency is very high (low variance), giving the model high confidence."*

### 4. Monte Carlo Win Simulation Engine

For every trade evaluation, the system simulates **500 complete NBA seasons** probabilistically. Each iteration:
- Injects Gaussian noise based on model RMSE to reflect real-world variance.
- Applies positional fit penalties (scoring cannibalization, roster depth issues).
- Factors in injury probability as a games-missed multiplier.
- Computes the team's expected win total for that simulated season.

The final projected win delta is the **mean across all 500 simulations**, producing a statistically robust estimate rather than a single fragile prediction.

### 5. Trade Score Formula

All model outputs are synthesized into a single **0–100 Trade Score** via a weighted composite:

| Component | Weight | Source |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Win Delta | 50% | Monte Carlo simulation engine |
| Playoff Probability Change | 20% | Sigmoid mapping of projected wins to playoff odds |
| Injury Risk Differential | 15% | Random Forest classifier |
| Roster Health Impact | 10% | Aggregate team medical depth score |
| Individual Medical Score | 5% | Traded player medical grade differential |

**Score Interpretation:**

| Score Range | Rating | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 80–100 | Exceptional | Franchise-altering improvement |
| 65–79 | Beneficial | Clear net positive for the team |
| 50–64 | Neutral | Trade is roughly a wash |
| 35–49 | Risky | Likely hurts the team's outlook |
| 0–34 | Harmful | Significant downgrade projected |
